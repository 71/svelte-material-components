# Svelte Material Components

This project delivers [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/) components for [Material Components Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) (MDC).

**WARNING:** This project is highly experimental. Actually, it's missing tests, documentation and examples to guarantee that everything is really OK. Pull Requests are totally welcome! But please, do not use on production projects yet! :)

## Features

- Use Svelte hooks to setup and destroy MDC's events and hooks;
- Import only what's really needed on the JS side, but without managing CSS loading (so you can customize everything using SCSS, for example..);


## TODO

- [ ] Tests;
- [ ] Documentation;
- [ ] Examples;
