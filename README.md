# Svelte Material Components

This project delivers [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/) components for [Material Components Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) (MDC).

**WARNING:** This project is highly experimental. Actually, it's missing tests, documentation and examples to guarantee that everything is really OK. Pull Requests are totally welcome! But please, do not use on production projects yet! :)

## Features

- Use Svelte hooks to setup and destroy MDC's events and hooks;
- Import only what's really needed on the JS side, but without managing CSS loading (so you can customize everything using SCSS, for example..);

## Examples

- [**Button**](https://svelte.technology/repl?version=2.11.0&gist=80396d2d73423440e8c4092c27f2f42a);
- More examples are welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request adding an example to this list, based on [our components](https://github.com/fjorgemota/svelte-material-components/tree/master/src) =)

## TODO

- [ ] Tests;
- [ ] Documentation;
- [ ] Examples - WIP;
- [ ] Guarantee that we are using good practices. For example...should we allow the user to customize the attributes of the root element of the component? I'm still thinking about that.
